## Summary

A regex, short for regular expression, is a string of characters that creates a particular search pattern. When used in programming or search functions, regex can help locate specific patterns within text or replace parts of the text. It's also commonly used to check if input follows the correct format.
Regex is a critical tool for developers because it allows for efficient text processing, data validation, and searching capabilities. Understanding regex can significantly enhance your ability to manipulate and work with strings in various programming contexts.

## Code snippet example :
^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([a-z0-9_\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.

## Regex Components
A regular expression (or regex) is a method for defining a pattern. It's used to find or verify specific text patterns within sentences, documents, or any other type of character input.

Regex combines both basic and special characters. Basic characters include standard letters, numbers, and common keyboard symbols, while anything else is treated as a special character

### Anchors
Anchors in regex are special characters used to specify positions within a string, rather than matching actual characters. They help define where a pattern should be located in the text. 

The two most common anchors are:
    Caret (^): This anchor asserts the position at the start of a line or string. For example, the regex ^Hello will match any string that begins with "Hello".

    Dollar Sign ($): This anchor asserts the position at the end of a line or string. For example, the regex world$ will match any string that ends with "world".
